# Codes-for-EAF-Seimic-Data-Set
These are the main codes to generate the figures of the paper "A high-quality data set for seismological studies in the East Anatolian Fault Zone, Türkiye" by L. Colavitti et al., in the journal Earth Science System Data.

This Package contains:

- Figure_01.sh            - Map of the data set for the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ)
- Figure_03.m             - Cumulative distribution function (CDF) per event and per station
- Figure_05-08-10.11.m    - Empirical Cumulative Distribution and histograms for P and S phases
                          - Depth comparison between our work and AFAD catalog
                          - Distrbution of the local magnitude relative standard deviation
                          - Magnitude comparison between our work and AFAD catalog
- Figure_06.m
- Figure_07.m
- Figure_09.m
- Figure_12.py
- Figure_13.m
- Figure_14a.sh
